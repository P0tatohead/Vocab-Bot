# Vocab-Bot
This python script just reads the vocab from one text file and spits it out into another

make sure to have two libraries installed (run these in powershell or command prompt if you have python with pip installed)
  1) wikipedia : pip3 install wikipedia
  2) PyDictionary : pip3 install PyDictionary

Clear the vocab.txt file and input the newest vocab from the Monkeys, 
Run the script and find the defintion.txt file with all of the defintions

IMPORTANT:
A "0" MEANS THAT THE CODE COULD NOT FIND A DEFINITION FOR THE WORD SO YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY LOOK IT UP. YOU CAN USE A SEARCH ENGINE OR THE GLOSSARY IN THE TEXTBOOK
